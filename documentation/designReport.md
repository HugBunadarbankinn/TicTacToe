##Introduction##
This design report is a part of an assignment in a class at Reykjavík University called Software Engineering. 
We are developing the well known console game TicTacToe and we will be using a Test-driven development (TDD) as well as GitHub (source control system) to store the code.
Other tools we are using are:
* Travis
* Gradle
