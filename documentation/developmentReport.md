#Development Report#

What is needed to get the project to run on a fresh machine.

* The code base is stored in a source contor system on [GitHub](http://github.com/) and it is necessary to download and have an account on GitHub.
* We use [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to write the code and to interact with GitHub.
* The code is written in java language so [Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) has to be installed.
* [Gradle 3.1](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) is used to build and run the game.
* We used Automated Continuous Integration Server, e.g. [Travis](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb).
