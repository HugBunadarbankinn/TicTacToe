##Introduction##
This design report is a part of an assignment in a class at Reykjavík University called Software Architecture. 
We are developing the well known console game TicTacToe and we will be using a Test-driven development (TDD) as well as GitHub (source control system) to store the code.
Other tools we are using are:
-Travis
-Gradle
-Heroku
-Selenium
