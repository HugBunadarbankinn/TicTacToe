# TicTacToe

- Our Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game. 
- The gameboard is a 3x3 grid, and the slots are numbered from 1-9 (from the top left hand corner). 
- The constructor of the class initializes an empty board and prompts the first player to enter a number between 1 and 9, representing the slot. 
- If the slot is free, an ‘x’ is put there, if it is not free the game asks the player to choose another slot. 
- After player 1 has finished her turn, player 2 goes through the same process, but with ‘o’, until we have a winner or the board is full and we have a draw.
